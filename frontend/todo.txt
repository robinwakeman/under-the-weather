Very Sophisticated Kanban Board
--------------------------------

To Do:

- add mobile version for components:
  - Select
  - Dialog?

- add media queries for chart page

- add tour to demo

- landing page animations

- connect date inputs to chart x-axis
-----------------------------------
In progress:

- basic ui for account page
  - type of arthritis
  - username
  - email
  - password reset

- basic ui for landing pages
  - root (index.js), links to:
    - sign in (login.js)
    - sign up (register.js)
    - demo the app ("log in" and load with fake data)

- back end
  - see tutorial: https://medium.com/swlh/jwt-authentication-authorization-in-nodejs-express-mongodb-rest-apis-2019-ad14ec818122

- weather api: darksky
- geocode+autocomplete api: here (autocomplete geocoder)

- weather metrics to include from darksky:
  - temperature, pressure, cloud cover, humidity, dewpoint, rain, snowfall, ozone, nearest storm, uv index, moon phase

--------------------------------------
Maybe later:

- refactor List component rating color-coding: override built-in MUI styles with classes

--------------------------------------
Futre plans:

- add grid view (heatmap grid)
- add statistics view (calculate how much the data is REALLY correlated to weather)
- add mood tracking (as an alternative to arthritis tracking)
