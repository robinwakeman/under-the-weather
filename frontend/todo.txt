  - see tutorial: https://medium.com/swlh/jwt-authentication-authorization-in-nodejs-express-mongodb-rest-apis-2019-ad14ec818122

- weather api: darksky
- geocode+autocomplete api: here (autocomplete geocoder)

- weather metrics to include from darksky:
  - temperature, pressure, cloud cover, humidity, dewpoint, rain, snowfall, ozone, nearest storm, uv index, moon phase
