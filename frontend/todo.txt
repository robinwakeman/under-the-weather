Very Sophisticated Kanban Board
--------------------------------

To Do:

- add mobile version for components:
  - Select
  - Dialog?

- add media queries for chart page

- add tour to demo

- make location input component
  - call geocode/autocomplete API

- use actual weather data

- put weather data in chart

- import font

- style delete-confirm dialog

- make a global user state for default location ?

- change time input so it only allows user to choose hour

- add missing/null values to chart for every day that
  user does not provide an entry

  High Priority To Do:
  --------------------------------

- order user entries by datetime in the database

- in chartview request data based on chart datepicker inputs

- add default location to user model

- re-fetch data when EntryDialog save button is clicked (chartview)

- make demo version account system

- basic ui for account page
  - type of arthritis
  - username
  - email
  - password reset

  - deploy app

  - update README

  Notes:
--------------------------------------
- back end
  - see tutorial: https://medium.com/swlh/jwt-authentication-authorization-in-nodejs-express-mongodb-rest-apis-2019-ad14ec818122

- weather api: darksky
- geocode+autocomplete api: here (autocomplete geocoder)

- weather metrics to include from darksky:
  - temperature, pressure, cloud cover, humidity, dewpoint, rain, snowfall, ozone, nearest storm, uv index, moon phase

--------------------------------------
Future plans:

- add grid view (heatmap grid)
- add statistics view (calculate how much the data is REALLY correlated to weather)
- add mood tracking (as an alternative to arthritis tracking)
